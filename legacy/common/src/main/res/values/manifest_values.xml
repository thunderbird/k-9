    We'd like to disable this component by default. However, due to a bug in Android versions prior to 12, users then
    wouldn't be able to use the home screen widget.
    See https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/85be035336af8d83eb24980026418207c85991cb%5E%21/#F0

    Previously, we've set this value to false on Android 12+ devices. However, a few people have reported widgets
    disappearing after updating to an app version containing that change. So for now we're back to having widgets
    enabled by default on all Android versions. We'll try again for Android versions released in or after 2025.
